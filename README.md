###Project One

TicTacToe is General Assembly's WDI-ATL cohort 5's first project.  TicTacToe was developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Manipulating the DOM, creating a solid front end, and successfully deploying the project were the main requirements.  Bonus features and other games were presented as options for this assignment.  This TicTacToe game does not fall into the bonus category.


###TicTacToe Basics

The game of tic-tac-toe is played with two players.  Each player has a symbol, either an x or o.  The players take turns entering their symbol into an available square.  The goal is to get 3 symbols in a row either across a row, down a column or on the diagonal.  The first player to do so wins.  Sometimes there is not a winner - this result is referred to as a cat's tail game.
